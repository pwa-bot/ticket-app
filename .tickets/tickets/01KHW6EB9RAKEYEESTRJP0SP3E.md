## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/api/space/attention` returns an explicit reason contract (`reasonCatalog`) with stable code/label/description/rank.
- [x] Each attention item includes `reasonDetails` and `primaryReason` so explainability is available without client inference.
- [x] `/space` renders reason explainability from the API contract (reason labels + helper text), not hardcoded-only strings.

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
