## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Added API contract tests for attention reason ordering and deduplication (`toReasonDetails`, `getReasonCatalog`).
- [x] Added precedence tests for multi-reason sorting tie-breakers (reason rank, merge readiness, priority).
- [x] Extracted sortable attention contract logic into a shared module to keep behavior testable and stable.

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
