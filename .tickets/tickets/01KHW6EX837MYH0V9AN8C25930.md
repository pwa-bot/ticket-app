## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Added Playwright E2E coverage for `/space` deep-link modal loading via `ticket` + `ticketRepo` query params.
- [x] Verified modal opens ticket detail even when current `repos` filter excludes that ticket from visible table rows.
- [x] Verified closing modal preserves current filters and removes modal query params from URL.

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes
