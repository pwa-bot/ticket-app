title: Merge readiness signal (checks + review + mergeable)
state: ready
priority: p0
labels:
  - merge
  - github
assignee: 'agent:openclaw'
reviewer: 'human:morgan'

## Problem

Teams need one "is it safe to merge" indicator. CI status alone is insufficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For each linked PR, compute:
  - checks: pass/fail/running/unknown
  - mergeable_state: clean/blocked/dirty/unknown
  - review_required: boolean + required reviewers if available
- [ ] Collapse into one badge per ticket:
  - Mergeable now
  - Waiting review
  - Failing checks
  - Conflict
  - Unknown
- [ ] Works from Postgres cache only
- [ ] Used in Attention view ranking

## Notes

Start minimal and improve as more webhook events are cached.
