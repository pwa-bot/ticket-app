# Marketing Site Spec v2 — Protocol-First

## Positioning

**Goal:** Position Ticket as a protocol-first execution ledger for agent-built software, with an open source CLI wedge and paid dashboard coordination.

**Do NOT lead with:**
- OpenClaw (mention in "Works with" strip only)
- "Board" or "Kanban" (dashboard is a view, protocol is the product)
- "Project management" language

**Lead with:**
- "An open protocol for machine-readable work in Git"
- "CLI for agents, dashboard for humans"
- Infrastructure framing, not PM tool framing

**Core pain we sell:**
> Agents need durable state, not chat memory.

Ticket turns ephemeral agent runs into persistent, auditable objects tied to code.

## Navigation

```tsx
const nav = [
  { href: "/protocol", label: "Protocol" },
  { href: "/cli", label: "CLI" },
  { href: "/dashboard", label: "Dashboard" },
  { href: "/pricing", label: "Pricing" },
  { href: "/docs", label: "Docs" }
];
```

**Header CTA:** Install CLI

---

## Home Page (`/`)

### Hero

**H1:** The open protocol for machine-readable work in Git

**Subhead:** Tickets are Markdown. State is YAML. History is Git. Agents use the CLI. Humans use a fast dashboard overlay.

**Primary CTA:** Install CLI
**Secondary CTA:** Read the Protocol
**Tertiary CTA (link):** Connect GitHub

**Microcopy:** Git is authoritative. Everything else is derived and disposable.

**Works with line:** Works with OpenClaw, Claude Code style runners, GitHub Actions, and custom orchestrators.

---

### Section: Why Ticket exists

**Headline:** Agents need durable state, not chat memory.

**Body:** Orchestrators execute well, but they do not reliably preserve backlog state across runs. Ticket turns work into a durable system of record that agents can read and write deterministically.

**Bullets:**
- No lost context between runs, machines, or sessions
- Work is inspectable, reviewable, and diffable
- Git history becomes the audit trail

---

### Section: The Protocol

**Headline:** A simple standard any tool can implement.

**Body:** The Ticket Protocol is CC0. Your repo remains the source of truth. Any CLI, dashboard, IDE plugin, or agent can interoperate by reading and writing the same format.

**Code block label:** Example ticket

```markdown
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Add paywall experiment
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: []
---

## Problem
…

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] …
```

**Tiny callout:** Core profile: just ticket files. Indexed profile: adds `config.yml` and `index.json`.

**CTA:** Read Protocol

---

### Section: Built for agents

**Headline:** Deterministic CLI, designed for automation.

**Body:** Ticket provides a strict CLI contract for agents. Use `--ci` mode for exact ID matching and structured output for reliable orchestration.

```bash
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment" --priority p1 --ci
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --json --ci
```

**Bullets:**
- Collision-free IDs (ULID filenames)
- Strict parsing and validation
- Machine-readable JSON output
- Works offline, commits changes atomically

**CTA:** CLI docs

---

### Section: Fast dashboard overlay

**Headline:** A clean view over what's already in Git.

**Body:** The dashboard reads `.tickets/index.json` generated by the CLI, then loads individual ticket files on demand. No separate source of truth.

**Bullets:**
- Board and list views
- Filters by state, priority, labels, repo
- PR linking by convention (branch and title)
- Read-only in v1, edit via git and CLI

**CTA:** Dashboard

---

### Section: Pricing teaser

**Headline:** Pay for coordination, not seats.

**Body:** The protocol is free. The CLI is open source. Upgrade for multi-repo portfolio views, saved filters, and team coordination features.

**Mini bullets:**
- Free: CLI + Protocol + single-repo dashboard
- Paid: multi-repo portfolio + saved views + faster refresh

**CTA:** Pricing

---

### FAQ
**Q:** Do I need ticket.app to use Ticket?
**A:** No. Tickets live in your repo. The CLI works independently.

**Q:** Who owns the data?
**A:** You do. Git is authoritative.

**Q:** Does this replace Linear?
**A:** If you use agents, it replaces the parts that break: durable backlog state, automation safety, and per-seat scaling.

---

### Footer CTA

**Headline:** Make your backlog something agents can operate reliably.

**Buttons:** Install CLI, Read Protocol, Connect GitHub

---

## Protocol Page (`/protocol`)

### Hero

**H1:** Ticket Protocol

**Subhead:** The open standard for machine-readable work stored in Git. CC0 licensed.

---

### Section: What it defines

**Headline:** A format, not a product.

**Body:** The protocol defines repository layout, ticket file format, workflow states, and the index schema. Any implementation can read and write tickets that conform.

**Includes:**
- `.tickets/` repository structure
- Ticket file format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body)
- Five-state workflow and transitions
- `index.json` schema for efficient querying
- Forward compatibility rules (`x_ticket` namespace)

**Does not include:**
- CLI commands
- Dashboard UI
- Pricing or business model
- GitHub-specific features

---

### Section: Conformance profiles

**Headline:** Core and Indexed

**Core profile:**
- Only requires `.tickets/tickets/*.md`
- Ideal for minimal tooling or manual workflows

**Indexed profile:**
- Adds `.tickets/config.yml` and `.tickets/index.json`
- Enables fast dashboards and large-scale querying

**Small note:** ticket.app requires Indexed profile.

---

### Section: Canonical example

**Ticket example:**

```markdown
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Example ticket
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: []
---

Markdown body…
```

**Index example:**

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-02-16T18:22:11Z",
  "workflow": "simple-v1",
  "tickets": [
    {
      "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
      "short_id": "01ARZ3ND",
      "display_id": "TK-01ARZ3ND",
      "title": "Example ticket",
      "state": "ready",
      "priority": "p1",
      "labels": [],
      "path": ".tickets/tickets/01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Section: Principle

**Headline:** Git is authoritative.

**Body:** Any caches, databases, or indexes are derived and disposable. If there is a conflict, ticket files win.

---

### CTA block

**Buttons:**
- View PROTOCOL.md
- Install CLI
- Connect GitHub

---

## CLI Page (`/cli`)

### Hero

**H1:** A CLI designed for deterministic automation

**Subhead:** Ticket is an open protocol. The CLI is the reference implementation for agents: strict mode, structured output, and safe validation.

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Install CLI
- Secondary: Read the Protocol
- Link: CLI docs

---

### Install

```bash
npm i -g @ticketapp/cli
```

---

### Quick start

```bash
cd your-repo
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment" --priority p1 --ci
git push
```

**Creates:**
- `.tickets/config.yml`
- `.tickets/template.md`
- `.tickets/index.json`
- `.tickets/tickets/<ULID>.md`

---

### Commands you'll use daily

```bash
ticket list --state ready
ticket show TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket start TK-01ARZ3ND --ci
ticket done TK-01ARZ3ND --ci
```

---

### Agent mode: `--ci`

**Headline:** Strict, non-interactive execution

In `--ci` mode:
- exact ID matching
- no fuzzy selection
- no prompts
- deterministic exit codes

```bash
ticket list --json --ci
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --json --ci
```

---

### Structured output: `--json`

**Headline:** Never parse tables

Use JSON for agents and automation:

```bash
ticket list --json --ci
ticket show TK-01ARZ3ND --json --ci
```

---

### Validation and recovery

```bash
ticket validate --all --ci
ticket rebuild-index --ci
ticket validate --all --fix-index --ci
```

---

### PR linking conventions

**Branch:** `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
**PR title:** `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

The dashboard links PRs automatically when conventions match.

---

- No. Agents are unlimited.

---

### FAQ

**Q:** Why not per-seat pricing?
**A:** Agent-driven teams scale identities quickly. We price coordination, not users.

**Q:** Is the dashboard required?
**A:** No. It's an overlay for visibility. Git remains authoritative.

**Q:** Can I mix plans across repos?
**A:** Yes. Pro is per-repo. Team is unlimited repos.

---

### Footer CTA

**Headline:** Start with the protocol. Add coordination when you need it.

**Buttons:** Install CLI, Connect GitHub, Read Docs

---

## OSS Page (`/oss`)

### Hero

**H1:** Open Source

**Subhead:** Ticket is open where it should be: protocol and tooling. Your data stays in your repo.

---

### Section: What's open

**Headline:** Protocol-first.

- Ticket Protocol is CC0
- CLI is open source
- Docs and examples are open

---

### Section: What's paid

**Headline:** Pay for coordination.

Ticket.app is a hosted overlay for:
- multi-repo portfolio views
- saved filters and sharing
- faster refresh
- team coordination integrations

---

### Section: Compatibility promise

**Headline:** Protocol stability matters.

**Body:** The protocol is the interoperability contract. Implementations evolve, but the spec is the shared substrate.

---

### Contributing

- link to GitHub repos
- link to issues/discussions
- guidelines: keep protocol small, additive changes preferred

---

### CTA

**Buttons:**
- GitHub repositories
- Read the protocol
- Install CLI

---

## Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

### Hero

**H1:** A dashboard that reads from Git

**Subhead:** Ticket.app is a fast overlay on top of the Ticket Protocol. It reads `.tickets/index.json` and ticket files from your repo. Git stays authoritative.

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Connect GitHub
- Secondary: Read the Protocol
- Link: View pricing

**Microcopy:** Read-only in v1. Edit via CLI and git.

---

### Section: What the dashboard is

**Headline:** Visibility without moving your workflow into SaaS

**Body:** The dashboard does not replace your repo. It renders what's already there: ticket files and a derived index for speed.

**Bullets:**
- Board and list views across tickets
- Filters by state, priority, labels, repo
- Ticket detail view renders Markdown cleanly
- Deep links are shareable and bookmarkable

---

### Section: How it works

**Headline:** Two files power the UI

**Body:** Ticket.app uses the Indexed Profile of the protocol.

1. Tickets live as Markdown files:
   - `.tickets/tickets/<ULID>.md`
2. The CLI generates a derived index:
   - `.tickets/index.json`

**Result:** Fast loading without a canonical database.

**Small note:** If index.json is stale, ticket files are authoritative.

---

### Section: PR linking and merge context

**Headline:** Link work to code by convention

**Body:** If your branch and PR title follow the convention, the dashboard links them automatically.

**Branch:** `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
**PR title:** `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

**What you see:**
- Linked PRs on ticket detail
- CI status (if available)
- Last updated signals

---

### Section: Multi-repo portfolio (paid)

**Headline:** See work across all repos

**Body:** Upgrade for portfolio views across multiple repos, saved filters, and shareable dashboards.

**Examples:**
- "All ready tickets across repos"
- "Everything blocked"
- "P0 and P1 in flight"

---

### Section: Security and permissions

**Headline:** Read-only by default

**Body:** In v1, Ticket.app does not write to your repo. It reads selected repos via GitHub OAuth and respects GitHub permissions.

**Bullets:**
- Repo allowlist (only repos you select)
- Tokens stored securely
- Webhooks optional later for faster refresh

**CTA:** Read Security

---

### FAQ

**Q:** Do I need the dashboard to use Ticket?
**A:** No. The protocol and CLI work without any hosted service.

**Q:** What happens if I stop paying?
**A:** Nothing breaks. Your tickets remain in Git. You just lose hosted coordination features.

**Q:** Why not just use GitHub Issues?
**A:** Ticket is a protocol: specs in Markdown, deterministic CLI for agents, and a fast derived index for overlays.

---

### Footer CTA

**Headline:** Add visibility when you want it. Keep Git as the source of truth.

**Buttons:** Connect GitHub, View pricing, Install CLI
