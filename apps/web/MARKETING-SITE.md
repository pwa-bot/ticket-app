# Marketing Site Spec for ticket.app

## Positioning

**Do NOT lead with OpenClaw.** Lead with the broader value prop.

**H1:** Git-native issue tracking for AI-first teams  
**Subhead:** Tickets are Markdown in your repo. Agents use the CLI. Humans use a clean dashboard. No seats. No agent accounts.

**OpenClaw mention:** "Works with" strip — OpenClaw, Claude Code, GitHub Actions, any orchestrator.

---

## Site Goals

1. Explain the product in 10 seconds to agent-native builders
2. Drive two conversion paths: Install CLI (free) / Connect GitHub (paid upsell)
3. Build trust: security, "Git is source of truth", no per-seat pricing
4. Feel premium and inevitable (Linear, Notion, Stripe vibes)

**Avoid:** Kanban-clone vibes, enterprise PM vibes, over-indexing on OpenClaw.

## Home Page (`/`)

### Hero
- **H1:** Git-native issue tracking for AI-first teams
- **Subhead:** Tickets are Markdown in your repo. Agents use the CLI. Humans use a clean dashboard. No seats. No agent accounts.
- **Primary CTA:** Install CLI
- **Secondary CTA:** Connect GitHub
- **Microcopy:** CLI is free and open source. Dashboard reads from your repo.
- **Works with pills:** OpenClaw, Claude Code, GitHub Actions, any orchestrator

### Section: The simplest possible tracker
**Headline:** Your backlog is a folder.

**Body:** Ticket lives in your repo under `.tickets/`. Each ticket is a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Git history is your audit log.

**Bullets:**
- No SaaS database as the source of truth
- Offline by default
- Easy for agents to create and update deterministically

**Code block:**
```md

id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Add paywall experiment
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: []

## Acceptance Criteria

```

### Section: Built for agents
**Headline:** Deterministic CLI. No flakey automation.

**Body:** Agents should not need a browser. Ticket exposes a predictable CLI with `--ci` mode for strict, non-interactive workflows.

**Commands:**
```bash
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment"
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress
ticket validate --ci
```

**Bullets:**
- Collision-free IDs (ULID filenames)
- Strict parsing and validation
- Git hooks to prevent broken tickets from landing

### Section: Dashboard overlay
**Headline:** A fast view over what's already in Git.

**Body:** The dashboard reads `.tickets/index.json` generated by the CLI, then loads individual tickets on demand. No replatforming your workflow.

**Bullets:**
- Kanban and list views
- Filter by state, priority, label, repo
- Auto-link PRs by branch and title convention

**Note (small):** Dashboard is read-only in v1. Edit via CLI and git.

### Section: Why not Linear or GitHub Issues?
**Headline:** Built for the agent era.

| Linear | GitHub Issues | Ticket |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Great UI, wrong billing for agents | Repo-native but not agent-first | Repo-native + agent-grade CLI |
| Seats get expensive with bots | Specs feel bolted on | No per-seat fees |

### Section: Pricing teaser
**Headline:** Pay for coordination, not users.
**Body:** Unlimited agents. No per-seat billing. Start free with the CLI, upgrade for multi-repo dashboard and team features.

### Section: FAQ
- **Q:** Do I need ticket.app to use Ticket? **A:** No. CLI and format work without hosted service.
- **Q:** Who owns the data? **A:** You do. Tickets live in your repo.
- **Q:** Does this work with my orchestrator? **A:** If it can run a CLI or commit files, yes.

### Footer CTA
**Headline:** Replace issue tracking with something your agents can actually use.
Buttons: Install CLI, Connect GitHub

## CLI Page (`/cli`)

### Hero
**H1:** A CLI designed for agents
**Subhead:** Deterministic commands, strict validation, collision-free IDs. Your orchestrator can operate tickets without touching a browser.

### Install
```bash
npm i -g @ticketapp/cli
```

### Quick start
```bash
cd your-repo
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment"
git push
```

### Common commands
```bash
ticket list --state=ready
ticket show TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket start TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket done TK-01ARZ3ND
```

### Agent mode (`--ci`)
**Headline:** Built for non-interactive automation

`--ci` mode disables fuzzy matching and interactive prompts. Fails fast with deterministic exit codes.

```bash
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --ci
```

Rules:
- IDs must be exact ULID or unambiguous short ID
- No fuzzy title matching
- `ticket edit` errors in CI mode

### Validation and hooks
```bash
ticket validate --all
ticket install-hooks
```

### PR linking conventions
Branch: `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
PR title: `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

### FAQ
- **Q:** Can I create tickets offline? **A:** Yes. Push when ready.
- **Q:** Who owns the data? **A:** You do. It's in your repo.

## Pricing Page (`/pricing`)

### Hero

- Saved views and filters
- Faster refresh (webhooks)
- Team-ready sharing (read-only links)

**Best for:** teams with a handful of active repos

#### Team — $20/month flat
Everything in Pro, plus:

### FAQ

- **Q:** Why not per-seat? **A:** Agent teams scale users artificially. We price on repos and coordination.

## Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

### Hero
**H1:** A dashboard that reads straight from Git
**Subhead:** Ticket's dashboard is a fast view over `.tickets/index.json` and your ticket files. No separate source of truth. No syncing your backlog into a SaaS.

**Primary CTA:** Connect GitHub
**Secondary CTA:** Read the docs
**Small line:** Read-only in v1. Edit via CLI and git.

### Section: How it works
**Headline:** Repo-native by design

**Body:** The dashboard loads one file, then fetches individual tickets only when you open them.

**Steps:**
1. CLI generates `.tickets/index.json` on every change
2. Dashboard reads `index.json` for board and list views
3. Clicking a ticket loads the Markdown file and renders it
4. PRs link automatically by branch and title convention

### Section: Views
**Headline:** Fast views for scanning and triage

**Cards:**
- **Board view:** Columns = workflow states
- **List view:** Filter by state, priority, label, repo
- **Ticket detail:** Rendered Markdown plus linked PRs

**Note:** No editing in the web UI in v1. That keeps the protocol clean and agent-friendly.

### Section: PR linking
**Headline:** PRs connect themselves

**Body:** If your branch and PR title follow the convention, Ticket links them automatically.

Branch: `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
PR title: `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

**Result:** Ticket detail shows linked PRs and current status.

### Section: Multi-repo portfolio (teaser)
**Headline:** See all work across repos
**Body:** On Pro and Team, you can view tickets across multiple repos in one place, with saved filters and views.
**Note:** Your tickets still live in each repo.

### FAQ
- **Q:** Does Ticket store my tickets? **A:** No. Tickets live in your repo. The dashboard reads and renders them.
- **Q:** What permissions does the dashboard need? **A:** Read access to selected repos only. It does not write to your repo in v1.
- **Q:** How does it stay up to date? **A:** MVP supports manual refresh. Paid plans can enable webhooks for instant refresh.

## Security Page (`/security`)

### Hero
**H1:** Security by design
**Subhead:** Ticket keeps your backlog in Git. The hosted dashboard is an optional overlay and does not become your source of truth.

### Section: Data ownership
**Headline:** Your tickets live in your repo

- Ticket files live under `.tickets/` in your repository
- Git history is the audit log
- The dashboard renders what's already in Git

### Section: OAuth token handling
**Headline:** GitHub OAuth tokens are protected

- Tokens are stored server-side only
- Tokens are encrypted at rest
- Tokens are never logged
- We request the minimum access needed for selected repos

**If access is revoked or expired:** We stop indexing and prompt you to reconnect.

### Section: Read-only in v1
**Headline:** No write access required

In v1, the dashboard is read-only:
- It does not edit ticket files
- It does not merge PRs
- It does not modify your repo

This reduces risk and keeps Git canonical.

### Section: Webhooks (when enabled)
**Headline:** Verified, signed, and replay-safe

When webhooks are enabled:
- Webhook signatures are verified
- Deliveries are deduplicated by delivery ID
- Replay attempts are rejected

### Section: Repo selection
**Headline:** Least privilege repo indexing

- Only repos you explicitly select are indexed
- We respect GitHub permissions
- If access changes, indexing stops for that repo

### Section: Responsible defaults
**Headline:** Built for agent-heavy workflows

- The CLI provides strict validation for safe automation
- `--ci` mode disables interactive and fuzzy behavior
- Git hooks prevent malformed tickets from landing

### Footer CTA
**Headline:** Keep your workflow in Git. Add an overlay when you want it.
Buttons: Read the docs, Connect GitHub
