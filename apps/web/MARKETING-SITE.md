# Marketing Site Spec for ticket.app

## Branch

**Work on `marketing-site` branch.** Do not merge to main.
Vercel will auto-deploy a preview URL for this branch.

---

## Positioning

**Do NOT lead with OpenClaw.** Lead with the broader value prop.

**H1:** Git-native issue tracking for AI-first teams  
**Subhead:** Tickets are Markdown in your repo. Agents use the CLI. Humans use a clean dashboard. No seats. No agent accounts.

**OpenClaw mention:** "Works with" strip — OpenClaw, Claude Code, GitHub Actions, any orchestrator.

---

## Site Goals

1. Explain the product in 10 seconds to agent-native builders
2. Drive two conversion paths: Install CLI (free) / Connect GitHub (paid upsell)
3. Build trust: security, "Git is source of truth", no per-seat pricing
4. Feel premium and inevitable (Linear, Notion, Stripe vibes)

**Avoid:** Kanban-clone vibes, enterprise PM vibes, over-indexing on OpenClaw.

## Home Page (`/`)

### Hero
- **H1:** Git-native issue tracking for AI-first teams
- **Subhead:** Tickets are Markdown in your repo. Agents use the CLI. Humans use a clean dashboard. No seats. No agent accounts.
- **Primary CTA:** Install CLI
- **Secondary CTA:** Connect GitHub
- **Microcopy:** CLI is free and open source. Dashboard reads from your repo.
- **Works with pills:** OpenClaw, Claude Code, GitHub Actions, any orchestrator

### Section: The simplest possible tracker
**Headline:** Your backlog is a folder.

**Body:** Ticket lives in your repo under `.tickets/`. Each ticket is a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Git history is your audit log.

**Bullets:**
- No SaaS database as the source of truth
- Offline by default
- Easy for agents to create and update deterministically

**Code block:**

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] …
```

### Section: Built for agents
**Headline:** Deterministic CLI. No flakey automation.

**Body:** Agents should not need a browser. Ticket exposes a predictable CLI with `--ci` mode for strict, non-interactive workflows.

**Commands:**
```bash
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment"
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress
ticket validate --ci
```

**Bullets:**
- Collision-free IDs (ULID filenames)
- Strict parsing and validation
- Git hooks to prevent broken tickets from landing

### Section: Dashboard overlay
**Headline:** A fast view over what's already in Git.

**Body:** The dashboard reads `.tickets/index.json` generated by the CLI, then loads individual tickets on demand. No replatforming your workflow.

**Bullets:**
- Kanban and list views
- Filter by state, priority, label, repo
- Auto-link PRs by branch and title convention

**Note (small):** Dashboard is read-only in v1. Edit via CLI and git.

### Section: Why not Linear or GitHub Issues?
**Headline:** Built for the agent era.

| Linear | GitHub Issues | Ticket |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Great UI, wrong billing for agents | Repo-native but not agent-first | Repo-native + agent-grade CLI |
| Seats get expensive with bots | Specs feel bolted on | No per-seat fees |

### Section: Pricing teaser
**Headline:** Pay for coordination, not users.
**Body:** Unlimited agents. No per-seat billing. Start free with the CLI, upgrade for multi-repo dashboard and team features.

### Section: FAQ
- **Q:** Do I need ticket.app to use Ticket? **A:** No. CLI and format work without hosted service.
- **Q:** Who owns the data? **A:** You do. Tickets live in your repo.
- **Q:** Does this work with my orchestrator? **A:** If it can run a CLI or commit files, yes.

### Footer CTA

## CLI Page (`/cli`)

### Hero
**H1:** A CLI designed for agents
**Subhead:** Deterministic commands, strict validation, collision-free IDs. Your orchestrator can operate tickets without touching a browser.

### Install

Clone and build from source (npm package coming soon):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwa-bot/ticket-app.git
cd ticket-app/apps/cli
pnpm install && pnpm build
npm link
```

Or install via npm (when published):

```bash
npm i -g @ticketapp/cli
```

### Quick start
```bash
cd your-repo
ticket init
ticket new "Add paywall experiment"
git push
```

### Common commands
```bash
ticket list --state=ready
ticket show TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket start TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket done TK-01ARZ3ND
```

### Agent mode (`--ci`)
**Headline:** Built for non-interactive automation

`--ci` mode disables fuzzy matching and interactive prompts. Fails fast with deterministic exit codes.

```bash
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --ci
```

Rules:
- IDs must be exact ULID or unambiguous short ID
- No fuzzy title matching
- `ticket edit` errors in CI mode

### Validation and hooks
```bash
ticket validate --all
ticket install-hooks
```

### PR linking conventions
Branch: `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
PR title: `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

### FAQ
- **Q:** Can I create tickets offline? **A:** Yes. Push when ready.
- **Q:** Who owns the data? **A:** You do. It's in your repo.

---

## Pricing Page (`/pricing`)

### Hero
**H1:** Pricing that doesn't punish agents
**Subhead:** Unlimited agents. No per-seat fees. Start free with the CLI. Upgrade for multi-repo visibility and coordination.

### Tiers

#### Free — $0
- CLI (open source)
- Repo-native format (`.tickets/`)
- Single-repo dashboard view
- Board + list views
- PR linking by convention

**Best for:** solo builders, trying the protocol

#### Pro — $5/repo/month
Everything in Free, plus:
- Multi-repo dashboard
- Saved views and filters
- Faster refresh (webhooks)
- Team-ready sharing (read-only links)

**Best for:** teams with a handful of active repos

#### Team — $20/month flat
Everything in Pro, plus:
- Unlimited repos

- Slack notifications
- Activity feed (derived from Git)

**Best for:** small studios shipping multiple apps

#### Business — $50/month
Everything in Team, plus:
- Policy checks (GitHub checks)
- Required review enforcement
- Advanced analytics
- Priority support

**Best for:** teams that need guardrails

### FAQ
- **Q:** What happens if I stop paying? **A:** Nothing breaks. Tickets still in repo. CLI still works.
- **Q:** Do agents cost extra? **A:** No. Unlimited agents.
- **Q:** Why not per-seat? **A:** Agent teams scale users artificially. We price on repos and coordination.

---

## Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

### Hero
**H1:** A dashboard that reads straight from Git
**Subhead:** Ticket's dashboard is a fast view over `.tickets/index.json` and your ticket files. No separate source of truth. No syncing your backlog into a SaaS.

**Primary CTA:** Connect GitHub
**Secondary CTA:** Read the docs
**Small line:** Read-only in v1. Edit via CLI and git.

### Section: How it works
**Headline:** Repo-native by design

**Body:** The dashboard loads one file, then fetches individual tickets only when you open them.

**Steps:**
1. CLI generates `.tickets/index.json` on every change
2. Dashboard reads `index.json` for board and list views
3. Clicking a ticket loads the Markdown file and renders it
4. PRs link automatically by branch and title convention

### Section: Views
**Headline:** Fast views for scanning and triage

**Cards:**
- **Board view:** Columns = workflow states
- **List view:** Filter by state, priority, label, repo
- **Ticket detail:** Rendered Markdown plus linked PRs

**Note:** No editing in the web UI in v1. That keeps the protocol clean and agent-friendly.

### Section: PR linking
**Headline:** PRs connect themselves

**Body:** If your branch and PR title follow the convention, Ticket links them automatically.

Branch: `tk-{short_id}-{slug}`
PR title: `[TK-{short_id}] {title}`

**Result:** Ticket detail shows linked PRs and current status.

### Section: Multi-repo portfolio (teaser)
**Headline:** See all work across repos
**Body:** On Pro and Team, you can view tickets across multiple repos in one place, with saved filters and views.
**Note:** Your tickets still live in each repo.

### FAQ
- **Q:** Does Ticket store my tickets? **A:** No. Tickets live in your repo. The dashboard reads and renders them.
- **Q:** What permissions does the dashboard need? **A:** Read access to selected repos only. It does not write to your repo in v1.
- **Q:** How does it stay up to date? **A:** MVP supports manual refresh. Paid plans can enable webhooks for instant refresh.

## Security Page (`/security`)

### Hero
**H1:** Security by design
**Subhead:** Ticket keeps your backlog in Git. The hosted dashboard is an optional overlay and does not become your source of truth.

### Section: Data ownership
**Headline:** Your tickets live in your repo

- Ticket files live under `.tickets/` in your repository
- Git history is the audit log
- The dashboard renders what's already in Git

### Section: OAuth token handling
**Headline:** GitHub OAuth tokens are protected

- Tokens are stored server-side only
- Tokens are encrypted at rest
- Tokens are never logged
- We request the minimum access needed for selected repos

**If access is revoked or expired:** We stop indexing and prompt you to reconnect.

### Section: Read-only in v1
**Headline:** No write access required

In v1, the dashboard is read-only:
- It does not edit ticket files
- It does not merge PRs
- It does not modify your repo

This reduces risk and keeps Git canonical.

### Section: Webhooks (when enabled)
**Headline:** Verified, signed, and replay-safe

When webhooks are enabled:
- Webhook signatures are verified
- Deliveries are deduplicated by delivery ID
- Replay attempts are rejected

### Section: Repo selection
**Headline:** Least privilege repo indexing

- Only repos you explicitly select are indexed
- We respect GitHub permissions
- If access changes, indexing stops for that repo

### Section: Responsible defaults
**Headline:** Built for agent-heavy workflows

- The CLI provides strict validation for safe automation
- `--ci` mode disables interactive and fuzzy behavior
- Git hooks prevent malformed tickets from landing

### Footer CTA
**Headline:** Keep your workflow in Git. Add an overlay when you want it.
Buttons: Read the docs, Connect GitHub

# Docs

Ticket is a Git-native issue tracking protocol.

- Tickets live as Markdown files in your repo under `.tickets/`
- YAML frontmatter stores structured state
- The CLI is the agent interface
- The dashboard is an optional read-only overlay

## Start here

1) [Getting started](./getting-started)
2) [Ticket format](./format)
3) [Workflow](./workflow)
4) [index.json](./index-json)
5) [CLI reference](./cli)
6) [PR linking](./pr-linking)

## Core idea

Your backlog is a folder. Your specs are Markdown. Your audit log is git history.
```

### `content/docs/getting-started.mdx`

````mdx
---
title: Getting started
description: Install Ticket, initialize a repo, and create your first ticket.
---

# Getting started

## Install

Choose one install method. Exact commands depend on how you publish the CLI. Examples:

```bash
# Homebrew (example)
brew install ticketapp/tap/ticket

# npm (example)
npm i -g @ticketapp/cli
```

## Initialize a repo

From your repo root:

```bash
ticket init
```

This creates:

* `.tickets/config.yml`
* `.tickets/template.md`
* `.tickets/index.json`
* `.tickets/tickets/`

Commit and push:

```bash
git add .tickets
git commit -m "ticket: init"
git push
```

## Create a ticket

```bash
ticket new "Add paywall experiment" --priority p1
```

This creates a new file in `.tickets/tickets/` with a ULID filename.

Push it:

```bash
git push
```

## Move a ticket

```bash
ticket list --state ready
ticket start TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket done TK-01ARZ3ND
git push
```

## Use with agents

Agents should use strict mode:

```bash
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --ci
```

In `--ci` mode:

* No fuzzy matching
* No interactive prompts
* Errors are deterministic
````

### `content/docs/format.mdx`

````mdx
---
title: Ticket format
description: File layout, YAML frontmatter rules, and templates.
---

# Ticket format

## Repo layout

```text
.tickets/
  config.yml
  template.md
  index.json
  tickets/
    01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md
```

Rules:

* Canonical ticket files are `.tickets/tickets/*.md`
* `index.json` is derived and regenerated by the CLI
* Git history is the audit log

## Filename and ID

* Filenames are full ULIDs (26 chars, uppercase)
* Frontmatter `id` must match filename stem exactly

Example filename: `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md`

## Minimal frontmatter

```md
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Add paywall experiment
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: []
---
```

Required:

* `id`
* `title`
* `state`
* `priority`

Optional:

* `labels` (array)

Derived (not stored):

* created_at: first commit that introduced the file
* updated_at: latest commit that touched the file

## Strict parsing rules

* UTF-8 only
* Frontmatter delimiter must be exactly `---` on its own line
* YAML must parse cleanly (no tabs)
* `state` and `priority` must be lowercase
* `labels` must be an array (use `[]` if empty)

## Default template

Ticket uses `.tickets/template.md` for `ticket new`. Example template:

```md
---
id: {{id}}
title: {{title}}
state: {{state}}
priority: {{priority}}
labels: []
---

## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
```

## Extension namespace (reserved)

Optional future metadata must live under `x_ticket`:

```yaml
x_ticket:
  source:
    kind: intake
    id: in_01J...
```

v1 CLI ignores `x_ticket`.
````

### `content/docs/workflow.mdx`

```mdx
---
title: Workflow
description: States, transitions, and terminal behavior in v1.
---

# Workflow

Ticket v1 uses a simple, hardcoded workflow.

## States

- `backlog`
- `ready`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`

## Allowed transitions

- `backlog -> ready`
- `ready -> in_progress`
- `in_progress -> done`
- `any -> blocked`
- `blocked -> ready`
- `blocked -> in_progress`

## Terminal behavior

- `done` is terminal in v1
- Tickets remain in `.tickets/tickets/`
- No archive folder and no automatic moves

## Why it is simple

The ticket body is the spec. The workflow is for coordination and visibility.
```

### `content/docs/index-json.mdx`

````mdx
---
title: index.json
description: Why it exists, how it is generated, and how to recover when it breaks.
---

# index.json

`index.json` makes the dashboard fast and avoids GitHub API rate issues. The CLI regenerates it on every ticket mutation.

## Location

`.tickets/index.json`

## Format

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-02-16T18:22:11Z",
  "workflow": "simple-v1",
  "tickets": [
    {
      "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
      "short_id": "01ARZ3ND",
      "display_id": "TK-01ARZ3ND",
      "title": "Add paywall experiment",
      "state": "ready",
      "priority": "p1",
      "labels": ["growth"],
      "path": ".tickets/tickets/01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deterministic ordering

To avoid noisy diffs, the CLI writes tickets in a stable order:

1. state order: backlog, ready, in_progress, blocked, done
2. priority: p0, p1, p2, p3
3. id lexicographic

## Recovery

If `index.json` is missing, corrupted, or out of sync:

```bash
ticket rebuild-index
```

To validate all tickets and fix index if needed:

```bash
ticket validate --all --fix-index
```

# CLI reference

Binary: `ticket`

## Commands

### init

```bash
ticket init
```

### new

```bash
ticket new "Title" --priority p2
```

### list

```bash
ticket list
ticket list --state ready
ticket list --priority p0
ticket list --label growth
```

### show

```bash
ticket show TK-01ARZ3ND
```

### move

```bash
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress
```

### start and done

```bash
ticket start TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket done TK-01ARZ3ND
```

### edit

```bash
ticket edit TK-01ARZ3ND --title "New title"
ticket edit TK-01ARZ3ND --priority p0
ticket edit TK-01ARZ3ND --add-label urgent
ticket edit TK-01ARZ3ND --remove-label wontfix
```

Modify ticket metadata without opening an editor. Supports `--ci` mode.

### assign

```bash
ticket assign TK-01ARZ3ND human:morgan
ticket assign TK-01ARZ3ND agent:openclaw
```

Set the assignee. Actor format: `human:<slug>` or `agent:<slug>`.

### reviewer

```bash
ticket reviewer TK-01ARZ3ND human:morgan
```

Set the reviewer. Same actor format as assign.

### validate

```bash
ticket validate
ticket validate TK-01ARZ3ND
ticket validate --all
ticket validate --all --fix-index
```

### rebuild-index

```bash
ticket rebuild-index
```

### branch

```bash
ticket branch TK-01ARZ3ND
```

### install-hooks

```bash
ticket install-hooks
```

## CI mode

Use `--ci` for agents and automation:

```bash
ticket move TK-01ARZ3ND in_progress --ci
ticket validate --ci
```

Rules in `--ci` mode:

* No fuzzy matching
* No interactive prompts
* Ambiguity is an error
* `ticket edit` errors

## Git hooks

* pre-commit validates changed ticket files
* pre-push validates changed ticket files only

Repo-wide validation should run in CI with `ticket validate --all`.

### `content/docs/pr-linking.mdx`

```mdx
---
title: PR linking
description: Branch and PR title conventions so the dashboard can link work automatically.
---

# PR linking

Ticket links PRs to tickets by convention.

## Branch convention

```text
tk-{short_id}-{slug}
```

Example: `tk-01arz3nd-paywall-experiment`

## PR title convention

```text
[{display_id}] {title}
```

Example: `[TK-01ARZ3ND] Add paywall experiment`

## Auto-linking logic

A PR is linked to a ticket if:

* PR title contains `[TK-<short_id>]`, or
* branch name contains `tk-<short_id>`

The dashboard displays linked PRs on the ticket detail view.
```

### `content/docs/policy.mdx` (reserved)

```mdx
---
title: Policy (reserved)
description: Reserved space for future policy enforcement. Not required in v1.

# Policy (reserved)

Ticket v1 does not enforce merge policy beyond GitHub settings.

Future versions may add an optional `.tickets/policy.yml` for advisory rules and GitHub checks.
