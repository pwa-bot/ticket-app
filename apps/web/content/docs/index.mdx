# Docs

Ticket is a Git-native issue tracking protocol.

- Tickets live as Markdown files in your repo under `.tickets/`
- YAML frontmatter stores structured state
- The CLI is the agent interface
- The dashboard is an optional read-only overlay

## Start here

1) [Getting started](./getting-started)
2) [Ticket format](./format)
3) [Workflow](./workflow)
4) [index.json](./index-json)
5) [CLI reference](./cli)
6) [PR linking](./pr-linking)

## Core idea

Your backlog is a folder. Your specs are Markdown. Your audit log is git history.
