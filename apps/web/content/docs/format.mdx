# Ticket format

## Repo layout

```text
.tickets/
  config.yml
  template.md
  index.json
  tickets/
    01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md
```

Rules:

* Canonical ticket files are `.tickets/tickets/*.md`
* `index.json` is derived and regenerated by the CLI
* Git history is the audit log

## Filename and ID

* Filenames are full ULIDs (26 chars, uppercase)
* Frontmatter `id` must match filename stem exactly

Example filename: `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md`

## Minimal frontmatter

```md
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Add paywall experiment
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: []
---
```

Required:

* `id`
* `title`
* `state`
* `priority`

Optional:

* `labels` (array)

Derived (not stored):

* created_at: first commit that introduced the file
* updated_at: latest commit that touched the file

## Strict parsing rules

* UTF-8 only
* Frontmatter delimiter must be exactly `---` on its own line
* YAML must parse cleanly (no tabs)
* `state` and `priority` must be lowercase
* `labels` must be an array (use `[]` if empty)

## Default template

Ticket uses `.tickets/template.md` for `ticket new`. Example template:

```md
---
id: {{id}}
title: {{title}}
state: {{state}}
priority: {{priority}}
labels: []
---

## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
```

## Extension namespace (reserved)

Optional future metadata must live under `x_ticket`:

```yaml
x_ticket:
  source:
    kind: intake
    id: in_01J...
```

v1 CLI ignores `x_ticket`.
