# Workflow

Ticket v1 uses a simple, hardcoded workflow.

## States

- `backlog`
- `ready`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`

## Allowed transitions

- `backlog -> ready`
- `ready -> in_progress`
- `in_progress -> done`
- `any -> blocked`
- `blocked -> ready`
- `blocked -> in_progress`

## Terminal behavior

- `done` is terminal in v1
- Tickets remain in `.tickets/tickets/`
- No archive folder and no automatic moves

## Why it is simple

The ticket body is the spec. The workflow is for coordination and visibility.
