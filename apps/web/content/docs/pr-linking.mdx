# PR linking

Ticket links PRs to tickets by convention.

## Branch convention

```text
tk-{short_id}-{slug}
```

Example: `tk-01arz3nd-paywall-experiment`

## PR title convention

```text
[{display_id}] {title}
```

Example: `[TK-01ARZ3ND] Add paywall experiment`

## Auto-linking logic

A PR is linked to a ticket if:

* PR title contains `[TK-<short_id>]`, or
* branch name contains `tk-<short_id>`

The dashboard displays linked PRs on the ticket detail view.
