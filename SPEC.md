# ticket.app v1.0.1 SPEC

## Git-native issue tracking for AI-first teams

---

## 1. What It Is

Ticket is a Git-native issue tracking protocol where tickets live as markdown files in your repository, operated by a CLI (agent interface), with a web dashboard (human interface) that reads the repo.

### Core Principles

- Git is the source of truth
- Markdown is the UI
- YAML frontmatter is structured state
- CLI is the agent interface
- Web dashboard is the human interface
- Never block local usage
- Never per-seat billing
- Monetize coordination, not storage

---

## 2. Repo Layout (Source of Truth)

```
.tickets/
  config.yml
  template.md
  index.json
  tickets/
    01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md
    01ARZ3P9E4C1N2EXAMPLE.md
```

Rules:
- `.tickets/tickets/*.md` are the only canonical ticket files
- `.tickets/index.json` is **derived** and must be regenerated by the CLI on every mutation
- The web app only needs `index.json` plus individual ticket files on demand

---

## 3. Ticket File Format

### 3.1 Filename

- Filename stem is the canonical ID
- Use full ULID, 26 chars, uppercase
- Example: `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md`

### 3.2 Frontmatter (Minimal and Strict)

```markdown
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: Add paywall experiment
state: ready
priority: p1
labels: [growth, onboarding]
---

## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion one
- [ ] Criterion two

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
```

### 3.3 Required Fields

| Field | Type | Rules |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | string | Must match filename stem exactly |
| `title` | string | Non-empty |
| `state` | enum | Lowercase: backlog, ready, in_progress, blocked, done |
| `priority` | enum | Lowercase: p0, p1, p2, p3 |

### 3.4 Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Rules |
|-------|------|-------|
| `labels` | array | Lowercase strings. Always include as `labels: []` if empty. |
| `assignee` | string | Actor responsible for implementation. Format: `human:<slug>` or `agent:<slug>`. |
| `reviewer` | string | Actor responsible for PR review. Format: `human:<slug>` or `agent:<slug>`. |
| `author` | string | Actor who created the ticket. Format: `human:<slug>` or `agent:<slug>`. Can be derived from git blame. |

### 3.4.1 Actor Format

Actors follow the convention `<type>:<slug>`:
- `human:morgan` — a person
- `human:mathieu` — another person
- `agent:openclaw` — an AI agent
- `agent:codex` — another AI agent

In v1, these are opaque strings. The CLI treats them as labels. Web can filter on them. Later versions may map to GitHub usernames or team memberships.

### 3.5 Derived Fields (Not Stored)

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `created_at` | First commit where file appears |
| `updated_at` | Latest commit touching file |

### 3.6 Strict Parsing Rules

- UTF-8 only
- Frontmatter delimiter is exactly `---` on its own line, both start and end
- YAML must parse cleanly, no tabs
- `state` and `priority` must be lowercase
- `id` must match filename stem exactly (case-sensitive)
- Unknown top-level keys are ignored unless under `x_ticket`

### 3.7 Invalid Ticket Handling

- CLI `validate`: fails with non-zero exit
- Web: shows "Invalid ticket format" badge, still displays raw markdown

### 3.8 Future Extension Namespace (Reserved, Ignored in v1)

```yaml
x_ticket:
  source:
    kind: intake
    id: in_01J...
  relations:
    blocks: []
    blocked_by: []
  last_run_id: run_01J...
  enforcement:
    required_reviews: 1
```

**Reserved fields under `x_ticket`:**

| Field | Future Purpose |
|-------|----------------|
| `source` | Link to intake/feedback system (`kind` + `id`) |
| `relations` | Dependency tracking (`blocks`, `blocked_by`) |
| `last_run_id` | Agent run trace reference |
| `enforcement` | Per-ticket policy overrides |

**Rules:**
- v1 CLI ignores `x_ticket` entirely
- v1 Web renders but does not interpret `x_ticket`
- Never store PII (names, emails, screenshots) in ticket files
- External references use `ticket://` URIs (see §17)

---

## 4. Workflow (v1 Hardcoded)

### States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `backlog` | Not ready to work |
| `ready` | Specced, ready to start |
| `in_progress` | Actively being worked |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external dependency |
| `done` | Complete |

### Transitions

```
backlog → ready
ready → in_progress
in_progress → done
any → blocked
blocked → ready
blocked → in_progress
```

### Terminal State

- `done` is terminal in v1, no reopen
- Tickets in `done` remain in `.tickets/tickets/` permanently
- No archive folder, no automatic moves
- Git history is the archive

---

## 5. Configuration

### `.tickets/config.yml`

```yaml
format_version: 1
id_prefix: TK
directory: .tickets/tickets
workflow: simple-v1

linking:
  branch_pattern: "tk-{short_id}-{slug}"
  pr_title_pattern: "[{display_id}] {title}"
```

### ID Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `id` | Full ULID (26 chars) | `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV` |
| `short_id` | First 8 chars of ULID | `01ARZ3ND` |
| `display_id` | `{id_prefix}-{short_id}` | `TK-01ARZ3ND` |

### `.tickets/policy.yml` (Optional)

Merge and approval policy. Separate from config to keep core format clean. Policy is optional — without it, agent uses sensible defaults (require human review for p0/p1).

```yaml
version: 1

merge_policy:
  default: review_required

  rules:
    - match:
        priority: [p3]
        labels_any: [polish, chore]
      policy: auto_merge_on_green

    - match:
        priority: [p0, p1]
      policy: require_approvals
      approvers: [human:morgan, human:mathieu]

approvers:
  human:morgan:
    can_approve: [p0, p1, p2, p3]
  human:mathieu:
    can_approve: [p0, p1, p2, p3]
  agent:openclaw:
    can_approve: [p3]  # Only low-risk tickets
```

### Merge Policies

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `auto_merge_on_green` | Agent merges (or enables GitHub auto-merge) when CI passes |
| `review_required` | Requires at least one approval before merge |
| `require_approvals` | Requires approval from specific actors in `approvers` list |

### Policy Enforcement

- **v1**: Policy is advisory. Agent respects it behaviorally.
- **v1.1+**: GitHub check validates policy before allowing merge.

Enforcement uses GitHub primitives (branch protection, CODEOWNERS, required reviews) — ticket.app does not reinvent these.

---

## 6. Template

### `.tickets/template.md`

Used by `ticket new`. Contains placeholders replaced by CLI.

```markdown
---
id: {{id}}
title: {{title}}
state: {{state}}
priority: {{priority}}
labels: []
---

## Problem

Describe the problem and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 

## Spec

Keep small specs inline. Link longer docs if needed.

## Notes

Any extra context, links, screenshots.
```

Rules:
- CLI replaces `{{placeholders}}`
- `labels` always included as `labels: []` for parsing predictability

---

## 7. Index File

### `.tickets/index.json` (Derived, Generated by CLI)

#### Purpose

- Makes the web dashboard fast and "no database" feasible
- Avoids GitHub API pagination and per-file parsing

#### Format

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-02-16T18:22:11Z",
  "workflow": "simple-v1",
  "tickets": [
    {
      "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
      "short_id": "01ARZ3ND",
      "display_id": "TK-01ARZ3ND",
      "title": "Add paywall experiment",
      "state": "ready",
      "priority": "p1",
      "labels": ["growth", "onboarding"],
      "assignee": "human:morgan",
      "reviewer": "agent:openclaw",
      "path": ".tickets/tickets/01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV.md",
      "extras": {
        "source_kind": "intake",
        "source_id": "in_01J..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field notes:**
- `assignee`, `reviewer`: Included if set in ticket frontmatter (for web filtering)
- `extras`: Optional object for future extension data (v1 ignores, v2+ can filter/group)

#### Regeneration Triggers

- `ticket new`
- `ticket move` / `ticket start` / `ticket done`
- `ticket edit` (if frontmatter changes)
- `ticket rebuild-index`

#### Deterministic Sorting

To avoid noisy diffs:
1. Primary: state order (backlog, ready, in_progress, blocked, done)
2. Secondary: priority (p0, p1, p2, p3)
3. Tertiary: id (lexicographic)

---

## 8. CLI Specification

Binary: `ticket`

### 8.1 Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Interactive (default) | Human-friendly, fuzzy matching allowed |
| `--ci` | Agent-safe, deterministic, no fuzzy matching |

In `--ci` mode:
- IDs must be exact ULID or exact short_id
- Any ambiguity is an error with non-zero exit
- `ticket edit` returns non-zero with `code=ci_mode_not_supported`

### 8.2 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ticket init` | Create `.tickets/` structure, config.yml, template.md, empty index.json |
| `ticket new "Title" [--priority p1] [--state backlog] [--label x]` | Create ticket with ULID, regenerate index, auto-commit |
| `ticket list [--state x] [--priority x] [--label x]` | List tickets from index.json |
| `ticket show <id>` | Display ticket details (fuzzy match unless `--ci`) |
| `ticket move <id> <state>` | Transition state, validate, regenerate index, auto-commit |
| `ticket start <id>` | Shortcut for `move <id> in_progress` |
| `ticket done <id>` | Shortcut for `move <id> done` |
| `ticket edit <id>` | Open in $EDITOR, validate on save, regenerate index, auto-commit |
| `ticket assign <id> <actor>` | Set assignee (e.g., `human:morgan`, `agent:openclaw`) |
| `ticket reviewer <id> <actor>` | Set reviewer for PR |
| `ticket validate [<id>] [--all] [--fix-index]` | Validate tickets, optionally regenerate index |
| `ticket policy [validate]` | Show or validate policy.yml (advisory) |
| `ticket rebuild-index` | Scan all tickets, regenerate index.json |
| `ticket branch <id>` | Print branch name, copy to clipboard if available |
| `ticket install-hooks` | Install git hooks |

### 8.3 Auto-Commit Policy

Commit message format:
- `ticket: create TK-01ARZ3ND Add paywall experiment`
- `ticket: TK-01ARZ3ND → in_progress`
- `ticket: update TK-01ARZ3ND`

Commits include:
- Ticket file changes
- index.json update

### 8.4 Collision and Ambiguity Rules

- ULID prevents filename collisions
- Prefix matching: error if multiple matches
- Title search: interactive chooser if multiple matches, hard error in `--ci` mode

---

## 9. Git Hooks

Installed by `ticket install-hooks`:

| Hook | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| pre-commit | Validate changed ticket files |
| pre-push | Validate changed ticket files only |

For repo-wide validation, use `ticket validate --all` in CI.

---

## 10. PR Linking

### Conventions

| Element | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Branch | `tk-{short_id}-{slug}` | `tk-01arz3nd-paywall-experiment` |
| PR Title | `[{display_id}] {title}` | `[TK-01ARZ3ND] Add paywall experiment` |

### Auto-Link Logic

A PR links to a ticket if:
- PR title contains `[TK-01ARZ3ND]`, OR
- Branch name contains `tk-01arz3nd`

Web shows linked PRs on ticket detail page.

---

## 11. Web Dashboard v1 (Read-Only)

### Features

- GitHub OAuth login
- User selects repositories
- Fetch `.tickets/index.json` per repo
- Kanban board view (columns = states)
- List view with filters (state, priority, label, repo)
- Ticket detail view with rendered markdown
- Linked PRs display
- Git history link (GitHub file history)

### Non-Features (v1)

- No editing via web
- No comments (use ticket body or PR)
- No approvals UI (use GitHub PR reviews)

### Refresh Strategy

MVP:
- Manual refresh button
- Optional: polling every N minutes

v1.1:
- GitHub App for automatic webhook installation
- Push events trigger index refresh

No canonical DB. Cache is disposable.

---

## 12. Monetization

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | CLI (open source), single-repo web view |
| Pro | $5/repo/mo | Multi-repo dashboard, webhook refresh |
| Team | $20/mo flat | Unlimited repos, Slack notifications |
| Business | $50/mo | GitHub checks for policy, analytics, org controls |

Never per-seat.

Approval philosophy:
- Approvals = GitHub PR reviews + branch protection
- Do not mutate ticket files for approvals in v1

---

## 13. Tech Stack

### CLI

- TypeScript
- Commander.js
- simple-git
- ulid
- gray-matter (frontmatter parsing)
- Vitest (testing)

### Web

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- next-auth (GitHub OAuth)
- Octokit (GitHub API)
- Vercel hosting

---

## 14. Security (v1)

### 14.1 GitHub OAuth token handling

- Use GitHub OAuth for user sign-in and repo access.
- Store OAuth access tokens server-side only.
- Tokens must be stored **encrypted at rest**:
  - Use a managed KMS if available (preferred), or
  - Use envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM with per-record nonce) with an app-level master key.
- Never log tokens.
- Only request minimum scopes needed:
  - MVP read-only dashboard: `repo:read` equivalent permissions (exact scopes depend on GitHub OAuth app settings).
- Support token revocation:
  - If GitHub returns 401, mark token invalid and prompt reconnect.

### 14.2 Webhook verification (v1.1)

If using webhooks (not required for MVP), verify all deliveries:

- Verify GitHub webhook signature (HMAC) using the webhook secret.
- Reject requests with:
  - Missing signature headers
  - Invalid signature
- Implement replay protection:
  - Store recent delivery IDs (or event IDs) for 24 hours in a dedupe store.
  - If a delivery ID repeats, ignore it.
  - Apply a timestamp tolerance if GitHub provides a timestamp header (if not, delivery ID dedupe is sufficient).

### 14.3 Least privilege and repo selection

- Web app must only index repositories explicitly selected by the authenticated user/org.
- Do not index all accessible repos by default.
- Store a per-org allowlist of repo IDs.
- If repo permissions change (removed access), remove it from index and show "access lost" in UI.

### 14.4 Data safety boundaries

- The web app is read-only in v1:
  - No ticket mutations via web.
  - No write operations to GitHub aside from optional webhook installation in v1.1 via GitHub App.
- Any future write features must be implemented via PRs or GitHub checks rather than direct file mutations.

### 14.5 Rate limiting

- Apply IP-based rate limiting on OAuth and webhook endpoints.
- Suggested limits:
  - OAuth endpoints: 10 requests/minute per IP
  - Webhook endpoints: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Use standard 429 responses with Retry-After header.

## 15. MVP Scope

### CLI (Week 1)

1. `init` + template generation
2. `new` + ULID + file write
3. parse/validate frontmatter
4. `move`/`start`/`done` transitions
5. `index.json` generation
6. `rebuild-index`
7. auto-commit integration
8. `install-hooks`

### Web (Week 1-2)

- GitHub OAuth
- Repo selection
- Fetch index.json
- Kanban board view
- List view with filters
- Ticket detail rendering
- PR linking display (basic)

### Out of Scope

- Editable web UI
- Approvals UI
- Custom workflows
- Slack
- Analytics

## 16. Agent Usage (OpenClaw)

Instructions for any OpenClaw instance:

1. Clone repo
2. Ensure `ticket` CLI available
3. Use CLI commands (preferred) or edit files directly
4. CLI regenerates index.json automatically
5. Push changes

Agent-safe usage:
- Always use `--ci` mode
- Reference tickets by exact short_id or full id
- Avoid title fuzzy matching in automation

Optional skill wrapper:
- `ticket` skill calls CLI actions and pushes commits

### PR Comment Commands

Agents monitor PR comments for mentions. Deterministic command grammar:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `@openclaw fix lint` | Fix linting errors, push commit |
| `@openclaw implement requested changes` | Address review feedback |
| `@openclaw rebase and update` | Rebase on main, resolve conflicts |
| `@openclaw merge when green` | Enable auto-merge or merge when CI passes |

Agent always replies with:
1. What action it will take
2. Link to commit(s) pushed
3. What is still pending (tests, review)

### Agent Policy Behavior

Agent reads `.tickets/policy.yml` to determine behavior:

- **auto_merge_on_green**: Agent merges or enables GitHub auto-merge when CI passes
- **review_required**: Agent waits for human approval, pings reviewer if stale
- **require_approvals**: Agent waits for specific approvers, does not bypass

Policy is advisory in v1. GitHub branch protection provides hard enforcement.

---

## 17. Link Schemes (Reserved)

Standard URI formats for cross-referencing:

| Scheme | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `ticket://<repo>/<id>` | Link to ticket in repo | `ticket://pwa-bot/fasting-app/01ARZ3ND` |
| `ticket://intake/<id>` | Link to intake object (future) | `ticket://intake/in_01J...` |

**Usage in ticket body:**

```markdown
## Source

Intake: ticket://intake/in_01J...
```

**Rules:**
- v1 treats these as plain text
- v2+ web may render as clickable links
- Prefer body `## Source` section over `x_ticket.source` for human readability

---

## 18. Data Governance

### 18.1 No PII in Repository

Ticket files must **never** contain:
- Raw user emails
- User real names (unless public contributors)
- Screenshots with PII
- Support conversation transcripts

If intake/feedback systems exist (future), they store PII in hosted overlay with proper retention policies. Ticket files contain only:
- Sanitized summary
- Reference URI (`ticket://intake/<id>`)

### 18.2 Repository is Source of Truth

The web dashboard caches and indexes but **never stores authoritative state**.

- All ticket state lives in `.tickets/` files
- Web cache is disposable — can be rebuilt from repo
- If web cache and repo disagree, repo wins

### 18.3 Future Write Operations Must Be PR-Based

One-way door to avoid: server directly editing ticket files on `main`.

When/if web writes are added:
- Web creates PRs that add/edit ticket files
- Merge applies the change
- Git history remains the audit trail
- No "shadow writes" that bypass git

This ensures:
- Full audit trail via `git log`
- Branch protection still applies
- Human review possible for any mutation

---

## 19. Future Extensibility (Reserved, Not Built)

These features are **not in v1** but the format preserves the path:

| Feature | Hook Reserved |
|---------|---------------|
| In-app feedback intake | `x_ticket.source`, `ticket://intake/` |
| Cross-repo portfolio | Web supports multi-repo from day 1 |
| Ticket relations | `x_ticket.relations.blocks`, `blocked_by` |
| Agent run traces | `x_ticket.last_run_id` |
| Attachments | `## Links` body section (link, don't embed) |
| Custom workflows | `workflow` field in config.yml |

**Principle:** Reserve extension points now. Do not add product surface area now.

---

End of spec.
